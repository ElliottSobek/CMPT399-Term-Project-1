# CMPT399-Term-Project

## Points found about the project
- make project into MVC
- (possibly modify project to javafx)

## Bugs
- Trade value can be negative and causes the other player to instantly lose the game when they are finished
- The program crashes with an error when the player does not give a name after selecting how many players are in the game
- names can be numbers (intentional?)
- player colour does not change if there are multiple characters
